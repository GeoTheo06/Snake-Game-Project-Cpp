# Snake-Game-Project-Cpp

## Description
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using C++. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, trying to eat fruits and grow longer. The game ends when the snake collides with the boundaries of the screen or with its own body.

## Technologies Used
* C++
* Windows.h library (for console manipulation)
* conio.h library (for keyboard input)
* iostream library (for input/output operations)

## How to Set Up and Run
1. Download the executable file.
2. Open it.
3. Run it.

Instructions
* Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake's movement.
* Try to eat the fruit (marked as 'F') to gain points and make the snake longer.
* Avoid hitting the boundaries of the screen or colliding with the snake's own body, as this will end the game.
* Press 'x' to exit the game at any time.
